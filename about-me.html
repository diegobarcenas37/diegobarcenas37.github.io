	   		<h2>Diego's bio</h2>
	   		<p>Hello. My name is Diego, my full name is Diego Francisco Barcenas. I was born and raised in Hayward, California, born on April 9th 2004. I am currently a student at Impact Academy High School in Hayward. In August, I will be starting my Sophomore Year of High School. Previous schools I went to include Burbank Elementary and Impact Academy Middle Grades.</p>
	   		<p>I enjoy doing various activities, such as learning how to play different types of instruments, and coding. I also enjoy making art, both visual and digital (mainly on photoshop!). My favorite subject in School in general would be Math, and sometimes I use math to create art! Math is amazing, feel free to talk to me about it!.</p>

	   		<p> Also, one of my favorite things is the month of December, where I am always feeling unusually happy. I already enjoy talking about the holidays, and decorating. As mentioned, I really like music. It is good to have music in this world as it is a major healing power. Also, my favorite color is green! I like green stuff, and green landscapes. When I am older, I want to travel to Ireland, and expand my Irish vocabulary.</p>
